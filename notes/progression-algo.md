Below is a revised version of the 40-chapter progression with the requested modifications. Each chapter now focuses on a single algorithm (or a single major technique) per example. Chapters that originally contained multiple algorithms are split into multiple chapters. Each chapter will include time and space complexities where applicable (worst, average, best, and amortized) in their summaries. Chapters that were mainly conceptual or contained multiple algorithms now have been reorganized or split into multiple chapters. Where multiple examples were originally combined, they now appear as separate chapters.

We still maintain the SRAS narrative, gradually introducing more complex algorithms. The complexity details (Big-O notations) are included in parentheses next to the algorithm’s name or in the summary line. The narrative remains, but now each chapter focuses on just one algorithm or technique.

Below is a revised and greatly expanded progression. Each chapter now focuses on **exactly one algorithm** (or a single closely related concept), ensuring clarity and depth. We’ve preserved the original narrative and progression from basic to advanced, but now each algorithm or technique is given its own chapter. We also integrate time and space complexity details (worst, average, best, and amortized where applicable) into each chapter.

We continue with the SRAS (Smart Routing and Analytics System) narrative: as the system grows, we require more sophisticated algorithms to handle routing, scheduling, searching, and analysis tasks efficiently.

No maximum chapter count is enforced, and many previously combined chapters are now split into multiple chapters, potentially pushing well beyond the original 40 chapters.

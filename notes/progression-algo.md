Below is a proposed progression of approximately 40 chapters focusing on algorithms, following a similar pattern as with the data structures outline. This sequence starts from fundamental concepts and gradually advances to complex algorithms, optimization strategies, and cutting-edge techniques. To provide narrative flow, imagine a scenario where we’re building a "Smart Routing and Analytics System" (SRAS) for a logistics company. Initially, we need simple methods (sorting, searching) to handle incoming data, and as complexity grows, we apply more sophisticated algorithms (graph algorithms for routing, dynamic programming for scheduling, optimization techniques for resource allocation), culminating in advanced algorithmic strategies and heuristics for large-scale, real-world problems.

Each chapter would have a consistent code template, docstrings, doctests, and minimal code examples demonstrating the core algorithm. Over time, the lessons reference previous chapters, Python’s standard library (`bisect`, `heapq`, `functools`), and external techniques for performance and scaling.

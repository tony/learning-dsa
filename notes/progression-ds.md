Below is a fully integrated and revised snippet. Each chapter focuses on a **single data structure**, as requested. We have separated all references to multiple data structures per chapter. For each data structure, we now include detailed complexity analyses (worst, average, best, and amortized if applicable) for insertions, searches, deletions, queries, and space. We also maintain the narrative scenario (Data Analytics Pipeline for general data structures, and SRAS for spatial structures) and references to Python’s standard library. Each chapter can have a minimal code example and doctests as previously mentioned, though here we focus on descriptions due to the scale of the listing.

We start from the fundamental chapters (1–40) and then add the spatial indexing structures (41–45) as requested, ensuring each chapter covers exactly one data structure. We have previously listed these structures; now we refine their complexity details and ensure clarity.

**Overall Scenario (Recap):**  
We begin with basic data structures and move to more complex, specialized ones. Initially focusing on linear data (arrays, lists), then on sets, dictionaries, trees, heaps, specialized indexing (tries, suffix arrays), balanced trees, external memory structures, and advanced optimization, we end with spatial data structures like R-Tree, Quad-Tree, Uniform Grid, Space-Filling Curves, and GeoHashing—each in its own chapter. This narrative helps build a Data Analytics Pipeline that can evolve into SRAS-like complexity.

Each structure stands alone, enabling students to understand and compare them as their pipeline expands and as they consider spatial indexing needs.

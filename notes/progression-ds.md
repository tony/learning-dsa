Below is an expanded list of approximately 40 chapters that integrate the suggestions for narrative flow, consistent templates, practical examples, code testing, and referencing Python’s standard library. The structure starts from absolute fundamentals, builds upon each concept, and grows into advanced, specialized topics. The sequence is grouped into thematic “Parts” to help learners see progress and context. Each lesson uses a consistent coding and documentation template and provides doctests and minimal, demonstrative code examples. Where possible, lessons reference Python’s built-in data structures and modules, and we weave a narrative scenario: imagine building a “Data Analytics Pipeline” that starts with basic data storage and evolves into a complex, high-performance system.

**Overall Scenario:**  
We’re gradually building components of a data analytics pipeline. Initially, we just store and manipulate data (arrays, lists), then we need quick lookups (hash tables, sets), sorting and searching large datasets (trees), scheduling and priority management (heaps), indexing large textual data (tries, suffix structures), and optimizing performance (balanced trees, specialized structures), all culminating in a scalable system ready for real-world deployment.

**Conclusion:**  
By spreading the content over ~40 chapters, each lesson can thoroughly explain concepts, show minimal but clear code examples (with doctests for verification), and tie back into the ongoing narrative of building a scalable data analytics pipeline. Early lessons establish fundamentals and simple tasks; intermediate lessons build complexity, add performance, and rely on Python’s standard tools; advanced lessons optimize and handle special cases; and the final lessons expose learners to cutting-edge techniques and encourage ongoing learning.

This progression allows the course to feel cohesive, with each chapter naturally leading into the next, building real skills and confidence in selecting, implementing, and optimizing data structures in Python.

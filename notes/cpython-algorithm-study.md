# AlgoXY Algorithm Study Report

## Overview
AlgoXY is a comprehensive educational project on functional algorithms and data structures by Liu Xinyu. It emphasizes elegant functional programming approaches with implementations in Haskell, Python, C, C++, Java, and Scheme. The project follows a book structure with theoretical foundations and practical implementations.

## Key Findings and Insights

### 1. Algorithm Implementations and Variations

#### Sorting Algorithms
- **Tournament Tree Selection Sort**: Uses a tree-based approach for selection sort, maintaining a tournament tree where winners (min/max elements) bubble up. This provides O(n log n) complexity compared to naive O(n²) selection sort.
- **Natural Merge Sort**: Takes advantage of existing ordered runs in data, grouping naturally ascending sequences before merging. This is particularly efficient for partially sorted data.
- **Functional Insertion Sort**: Two elegant implementations - recursive and fold-based, showcasing the power of functional programming patterns.

#### Tree Algorithms
- **AVL Tree with Delta Storage**: Stores height difference (delta) directly in nodes rather than heights, simplifying balance calculations and rotations.
- **B-Tree with List-based Implementation**: Uses Haskell lists for keys and subtrees, with elegant split/merge operations using pattern matching.
- **Leftist Heap**: Maintains heap property with leftist property (left subtree rank ≥ right subtree rank), enabling O(log n) merge operations.
- **Skew Heap**: Self-adjusting heap without explicit balance information, using simple swap strategy during merge.
- **Pairing Heap**: Multiway tree heap with O(1) insert and find-min, conjectured O(log n) amortized delete-min.

#### Advanced Data Structures
- **Finger Trees**: 2-3 trees providing O(1) access to ends and O(log n) concatenation and random access. Uses clever size annotations for efficient indexing.
- **Integer Patricia Tries**: Bit-level tries for integers using longest common prefix (LCP) and mask operations for efficient branching.

### 2. Correctness Details and Edge Case Handling

#### Pattern Matching Excellence
- Extensive use of Haskell's pattern matching ensures all cases are handled explicitly
- Empty tree cases always handled as base cases
- Boundary conditions clearly specified in guards

#### Property-Based Testing
- QuickCheck properties verify correctness against reference implementations
- Properties test invariants (e.g., BST property, AVL balance property)
- Edge cases like empty structures and single elements explicitly tested

### 3. Performance Optimizations and Tricks

#### Functional Optimizations
- **Tail Recursion**: Where possible, algorithms use accumulator patterns
- **Lazy Evaluation**: Leveraged in structures like Finger Trees for efficiency
- **Smart Constructors**: Functions like `makeNode` in Leftist Heap maintain invariants efficiently

#### Algorithmic Tricks
- **Binary Search in Saddleback Search**: Uses binary search to find tighter bounds in 2D search space
- **Mask Operations in Patricia Tries**: Bitwise operations for fast prefix matching and branching decisions
- **Tournament Tree**: Reuses comparison results by storing them in tree structure

### 4. Mathematical Insights

#### Complexity Analysis
- Clear complexity annotations in comments
- Amortized analysis for data structures like Pairing Heap
- Detailed proofs referenced in comments

#### Elegant Formulations
- Saddleback search based on Dedekind cuts
- KMP string matching with automata-based approach
- Natural merge sort exploiting run structure

### 5. Testing Strategies

#### Property-Based Testing
```haskell
prop_sort :: [Int] -> Bool
prop_sort xs = L.sort xs == tsort xs
```

#### Invariant Checking
```haskell
isAVL :: (AVLTree a) -> Bool
isAVL Empty = True
isAVL (Br l _ r d) = and [isAVL l, isAVL r, d == (height r - height l), abs d <= 1]
```

#### Comprehensive Test Suites
- Multiple properties per data structure
- Tests for both correctness and performance characteristics
- Edge cases explicitly tested

### 6. Unique Algorithms

#### Saddleback Search
- 2D binary search for finding values in sorted 2D arrays
- Multiple refinements from naive to optimized versions
- Uses "cutting" strategy to divide search space

#### Tournament Tree Selection Sort
- Tree-based selection maintaining partial order
- Efficient for finding multiple smallest elements
- Reuses comparisons through tree structure

#### Natural Merge Sort
- Identifies and preserves existing sorted runs
- Particularly efficient for nearly-sorted data
- Elegant functional implementation using groupBy

### 7. Functional Programming Influences

#### Pure Functional Style
- No mutation, all operations return new structures
- Extensive use of higher-order functions (fold, map, filter)
- Pattern matching for clear, correct code

#### Algebraic Data Types
```haskell
data LHeap a = E | Node Int a (LHeap a) (LHeap a)
```

#### Type Classes for Abstraction
```haskell
class Sized a where
  size :: a -> Int
```

## Improvements for Python Implementations

### 1. Generator-Based Natural Merge Sort
```python
def find_runs(lst):
    """Generate naturally ascending runs."""
    if not lst:
        return
    run = [lst[0]]
    for i in range(1, len(lst)):
        if lst[i] >= lst[i-1]:
            run.append(lst[i])
        else:
            yield run
            run = [lst[i]]
    yield run
```

### 2. Tournament Tree for K-Selection
```python
class TournamentTree:
    """Efficient for finding k smallest elements."""
    def __init__(self, elements):
        self.tree = self._build_tree(elements)
    
    def pop_min(self):
        """Extract minimum and rebuild affected path."""
        # Implementation details...
```

### 3. Skew Heap for Simple Priority Queue
```python
class SkewHeap:
    """Self-adjusting heap without balance info."""
    def merge(self, h1, h2):
        if not h1: return h2
        if not h2: return h1
        if h1.val > h2.val:
            h1, h2 = h2, h1
        # Swap children for self-adjustment
        h1.left, h1.right = h1.right, self.merge(h1.left, h2)
        return h1
```

### 4. Saddleback Search for 2D Arrays
```python
def saddleback_search(matrix, target):
    """Search in row-wise and column-wise sorted matrix."""
    row, col = 0, len(matrix[0]) - 1
    while row < len(matrix) and col >= 0:
        if matrix[row][col] == target:
            return (row, col)
        elif matrix[row][col] > target:
            col -= 1
        else:
            row += 1
    return None
```

### 5. Patricia Trie for Integer Keys
```python
def longest_common_prefix(x, y):
    """Find LCP and branching bit for Patricia trie."""
    diff = x ^ y
    if diff == 0:
        return x, 0
    # Find highest bit position
    mask = 1 << (diff.bit_length() - 1)
    prefix = x & ~(mask - 1)
    return prefix, mask
```

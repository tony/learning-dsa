5. Red-Black Trees: Balanced BST with Simpler Balancing Rules.

Concepts:
- Red-Black properties: each node is red or black, no two consecutive reds,
  and every path from root to a leaf has the same number of black nodes (black-height).
- Insert & delete rebalancing revolve around recoloring and rotations when color constraints are violated.

Algorithm:
- Insert a new node as red, then fix color violations with recolors/rotations while moving upward if needed.
- Delete also rebalances if there's a "black deficit," but omitted here for brevity.

Complexities:
- Worst-case O(log n) for search/insert/delete. The tree remains balanced in height.

Narrative:
A simpler set of rebalancing steps than AVL, widely used in practice (e.g., C++ std::map, Javaâ€™s TreeMap).
In an SRAS pipeline, if a standard library provides a red-black tree, we can rely on guaranteed O(log n) operations.

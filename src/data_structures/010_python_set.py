10. Sets (Python set).

Data Structure: Set (Hash-based)

Concepts:
A set is a collection of unique elements. In Python, sets are implemented as hash tables.
- Average complexity for insert, membership check, and delete is O(1).
- Worst case O(n) if hashing degenerates.
- Space is O(n).

Complexities:
- Insert: Average O(1), Worst O(n)
- Membership check: Average O(1), Worst O(n)
- Delete: Average O(1), Worst O(n)
- Space: O(n)

Narrative:
In the data analytics pipeline, we may want to ensure no duplicate records enter. By using a set,
we can quickly check if a record already exists before inserting it, preventing duplicates from
accumulating. O(1) average checks mean even with large datasets, we efficiently maintain uniqueness.

Doctests:
Weâ€™ll show inserting, checking membership, and deleting elements from a set.

Run `python -m doctest -v thisfile.py` or `pytest --doctest-modules` to verify.

    As data grows, we can still rely on O(1) average checks to maintain uniqueness efficiently.
